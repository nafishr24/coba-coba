### **For You, My Someone Special**  

This is my first-ever web development project, and with all my heart, I dedicate it to someone truly special—someone who makes my heartbeat a little differently.  

I wanted to give you a birthday wish unlike any other, something no one has ever given you before. Because to me, you *are* extraordinary: beautiful, sweet, and brilliantly intelligent—like the perfect equation, one I keep solving in the light of your smile.  

I’ve woven simple words with code and formulas because that’s my way of stepping closer to your world. Even though I don’t know what the future holds, one thing is certain: **right now, I love you with all my heart—with every bit of logic and chaos in me.**  

Happy birthday, my love. May this day remind you just how precious you are—to the world, and most of all, to me.
